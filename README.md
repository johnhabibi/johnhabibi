# Marhaba, I'm John Habibi

I'm a Web Developer working with ♦️Ruby, 🚂Rails, 🐍Python, Django, and the usual JS frameworks.

I've also recenly taken an interest in 📱Mobile App Development - specifically with 🎯Dart/🕊Flutter.

I currently work for ⛽️Halliburton while also building 🤪Hypervite in public.

Follow [my Twitter account](https://www.twitter.com/JohnHabibiDev/ "John Habibi | Developer") to keep up with my work on Hypervite.

✌️Feel free to say hello regardless of the reason. I like meeting new people!
